INTRODUCTORY TEXT
The goal of this program is to take raw MEDPC data and produce usable
information on the timing of each event type (licks, lever presses, head
entries, reinforcements) and the intervals between events. This includes a
number of analyses of the microstructure of licking behavior (see
below). There is optional code that is commented out for more variables or
figures. This was last updated 1/9/18 by Emily Baltz. (Gremel Lab, UCSD
